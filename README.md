# Time Series Project 2018
Please refer to this repository is my "Time Series Project" in 2018 with Valentin Cure (valentin.cure2017@qcf.jvn.edu.vn) under the supervisor of Ms. Monique PONTIER (pontier@math.univ-toulouse.fr) from Institut Math√©matique de Toulouse. 

The Project covered the fundamental theories of Financial Time Series and its applications on the data of CAC 40 from 1998 until Apr-2018

This repository included the full report in pdf, its latex code and the original code from R, which presents under the jupyter notebook presentation.
